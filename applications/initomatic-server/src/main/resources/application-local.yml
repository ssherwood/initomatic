#
# Default "local" profile (optimized for the local development experience).
#
# The primary features of this profile include:
#
# - devtools will monitor the plugins paths to trigger reloads on any changes.
#
# - the initomatic-client/dist folder will be used as the primary static
#   location for Spring Boot to serve from 8080 (which is not the preferred
#   method to run the client in development, but it keeps new developers from
#   being confused at the 404 when run from within IntelliJ).
#
# - all actuator "management" endpoints are exposed and the health endpoint
#   always shows details (don't do this in production).
